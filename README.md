# TinyURL Clone Frontend

This is the frontend for a simple TinyURL clone application built with React. It allows users to shorten long URLs, making them easier to share. The backend is hosted separately and can be found [here](https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repo).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
